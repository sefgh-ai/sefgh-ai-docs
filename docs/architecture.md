# Search Engine Architecture

SEFGH-AI is built using modular components designed for flexibility and performance.

## Core Layers

- **Crawler**: Fetches and indexes content.
- **Indexer**: Prepares data for fast querying.
- **Query Engine**: Handles search requests with ranked results.
- **UI**: Web-based playground for real-time testing.

Each component can be swapped or customized independently.
